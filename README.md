# GitGraph.ts template

This is template for drawing gitgraph branch chart with TypeScript.  
You can generate `output.md` by this template (To tell the truth, this is HTML file. For converting that to image file, markdown is better than HTML for me.)

1. Edit `src/gitgraph.ts`

2. Exec `npm run build`

3. Then, `output.md` is genereted.

4. In my case, export as png file via vscode extension (Markdown PDF)
